# anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_flexgateway (Resource)

Create and Manage tls-context of type "FlexGateway" for a secret-group in a given organization and environment.
		This resource doesn't support delete. The delete operation only removes the resource from local terraform state file.
		Only the parent resource (secret-group) can be deleted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_flexgateway" "fg" {
  org_id = var.root_org
  env_id = var.env_id
  sg_id = var.secretgroup_id
  name = "context03"
  keystore_path = "keystores/ed570161-78cc-493f-9707-0f9ade7d8a1a"
  truststore_path = "truststores/a5a97893-acc2-4f50-bd2d-2ffbff304b90"
  min_tls_version = "TLSv1.3"
  max_tls_version = "TLSv1.3"
  alpn_protocols = tolist(["h2","http/1.1"])
  inbound_settings {
    enable_client_cert_validation = true
  }
  outbound_settings {
    skip_server_cert_validation = true
  }
  cipher_suites = tolist([])
}
```

- `sg_id` (String) The secret-group id where the tls-context instance is defined.

### Optional

- `keystore_path` (String) Refers to a secret of type keystore. Relative path of the secret to be referenced.

### Read-Only

- `expiration_date` (String) The expiration date of the tls-context
- `id` (String) Id assigned to this tls-context

### Nested Schema for `inbound_settings`

Required:

- `enable_client_cert_validation` (Boolean) Indicates whether the client certificate validation must be enforced.

### Nested Schema for `outbound_settings`

Required:

- `skip_server_cert_validation` (Boolean) flag that indicates whether the server certificate validation must be skipped.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# In order for the import to work, you should provide a ID composed of the following:
#  {ORG_ID}/{ENV_ID}/{SG_ID}/{SECRET_ID}

terraform import \
  -var-file params.tfvars.json \    #variables file
  anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_flexgateway.fg \                #resource name
  aa1f55d6-213d-4f60-845c-201282484cd1/7074fcdd-9b23-4ab3-97c8-5db5f4adf17d/39731075-0521-47aa-82b2-d9745f2ac2eb/59a82737-9926-4d70-b578-9d949b37a266   #resource ID
