# anypoint_secretgroup_truststore (Resource)

Create and manage a truststore for a given secret-group, organization and environment.
		This resource doesn't support delete. The delete operation only removes the resource from local terraform state file.
		Only the parent resource (secret-group) can be deleted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anypoint_secretgroup_truststore" "truststore" {
  org_id = var.root_org
  env_id = var.env_id
  sg_id = anypoint_secretgroup.sg.id
  name = "terraform-truststore-example-02"
  type = "PEM"
  truststore = "${path.module}/keys/myserver.local.crt"
}

resource "anypoint_secretgroup_truststore" "jks" {
  org_id = var.root_org
  env_id = var.env_id
  sg_id = anypoint_secretgroup.sg.id
  name = "terraform-truststore-example-jks-01"
  type = "JKS"
  truststore = "${path.module}/keys/my-terraform.keystore"
  algorithm = "PKIX"
  store_passphrase = "123456"
}
```

#  {ORG_ID}/{ENV_ID}/{SG_ID}/{SECRET_ID}

terraform import \
  -var-file params.tfvars.json \    #variables file
  anypoint_secretgroup_truststore.truststore \                #resource name
  aa1f55d6-213d-4f60-845c-201282484cd1/7074fcdd-9b23-4ab3-97c8-5db5f4adf17d/39731075-0521-47aa-82b2-d9745f2ac2eb/b2096f24-3ae3-4047-a481-41b5b102feba   #resource ID
