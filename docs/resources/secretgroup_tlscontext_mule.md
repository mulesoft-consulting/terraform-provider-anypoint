# anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_mule (Resource)

Create and manage tls-context of type "Mule" for a secret-group in a given organization and environment.
		This resource doesn't support delete. The delete operation only removes the resource from local terraform state file.
		Only the parent resource (secret-group) can be deleted.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_mule" "mule" {
  org_id = var.root_org
  env_id = var.env_id
  sg_id = anypoint_secretgroup.sg.id
  name = "terraform-tls-context-mule"
  keystore_path = anypoint_secretgroup_keystore.jks.path
  truststore_path = anypoint_secretgroup_truststore.jks.path
  cipher_suites = tolist([])
  acceptable_tls_versions {
    tls_v1_dot1 = false
    tls_v1_dot2 = true
    tls_v1_dot3 = true
  }
  insecure = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `acceptable_tls_versions` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) TLS versions supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--acceptable_tls_versions))
- `env_id` (String) The environment id where the tls-context's secret group is defined.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Setting this flag to true indicates that certificate validation should not be enforced, i.e. the truststore, even though set, is ignored at runtime. Only available for "Mule" target
- `name` (String) The name of the tls-context
- `org_id` (String) The organization id where the tls-context's secret group is defined.
- `sg_id` (String) The secret-group id where the tls-context instance is defined.

### Optional

- `cipher_suites` (Set of String) List of enabled cipher suites for Mule target.
- `keystore_path` (String) Refers to a secret of type keystore. Relative path of the secret to be referenced.
- `truststore_path` (String) Refers to a secret of type truststore. Relative path of the secret to be referenced.

### Read-Only

- `expiration_date` (String) The expiration date of the tls-context
- `id` (String) Id assigned to this tls-context
- `last_updated` (String) The last time this resource has been updated locally.
- `path` (String) The path of the tls-context
- `target` (String) The target application for the tls-context

### Nested Schema for `acceptable_tls_versions`

Required:

- `tls_v1_dot1` (Boolean) TLS version 1.1
- `tls_v1_dot2` (Boolean) TLS version 1.2
- `tls_v1_dot3` (Boolean) TLS version 1.3

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# In order for the import to work, you should provide a ID composed of the following:
#  {ORG_ID}/{ENV_ID}/{SG_ID}/{SECRET_ID}

terraform import \
  -var-file params.tfvars.json \    #variables file
  anypoint_secretgroup_tlscontext_mule.mule \                #resource name
  aa1f55d6-213d-4f60-845c-201282484cd1/7074fcdd-9b23-4ab3-97c8-5db5f4adf17d/39731075-0521-47aa-82b2-d9745f2ac2eb/b2096f24-3ae3-4047-a481-41b5b102feba   #resource ID
```
