## Welcome to the Terraform Anypoint Provider repository

Are you ready to supercharge your infrastructure as code (IaC) game for MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform? Look no further! The Terraform Anypoint Provider empowers you to manage Anypoint resources seamlessly using Terraform.

## What is the Terraform Anypoint Provider?

**Terraform** is the industry-standard tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure efficiently. With Terraform, you can describe your infrastructure as code, apply version control, and automate provisioning and configuration tasks.

**Anypoint Platform** by MuleSoft is a leading integration platform that allows you to connect applications, data, and devices in the cloud and on-premises. It's a powerful tool for API management, integration, and more.

**The Terraform Anypoint Provider** bridges the gap between these two worlds. It enables you to define your Anypoint resources, configurations, and integrations in code, providing you with the ability to automate deployments, enhance collaboration, reduce errors, and track changes with ease.

## What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you'll discover:

* **Provider Code:** The source code for the Terraform Anypoint Provider, which allows you to interact with Anypoint Platform resources in your Terraform configurations.

* **Documentation:** Detailed guides, examples, and reference materials to help you get started and make the most of the Terraform Anypoint Provider.

* **Issues and Contributions:** A space to report issues, suggest improvements, and contribute to the development of the provider. We welcome your contributions and feedback!

## How it works

This provider uses the anypoint platform APIs to perform actions for each one of the implemented resources.

![alt text](drive/imgs/provider-arch.png)

We use the **anypoint client library** as an abstraction layer to perform actions on the platform.

For better maintainability and in order to speed up the development process, the **anypoint client library** is a library generated from OAS3 specifications written by the community.

The following image describes the delivery cycle:

![alt text](drive/imgs/provider-deliver.png)

The cycle is composed of 3 steps:

  1. Pick one resource and understand how it works using tools like Postman, anypoint's documentation and your favorite browser's inspector.
  2. Create the OAS3 specification. The specification should at least contain GET, POST and DELETE operations.
  The specification should be contributed [here](https://github.com/mulesoft-anypoint/anypoint-automation-client-generator). Using the OAS spec, a go module will be generated and pushed [here](https://github.com/mulesoft-anypoint/anypoint-client-go).

  3. Implement the resource and related data sources in the provider using the generated library.

## Getting Started

### How to use

Run the following command to build the provider

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-anypoint
```

**N.B:** As of Go 1.13 make sure that your `GOPRIVATE` environment variable includes `github.com/mulesoft-anypoint`

```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/mulesoft-anypoint
```

### Test sample configuration

First, build and install the provider.

```bash
make install
```

Then, navigate inside the `examples` folder, and update your credentials in `main.tf`.
Run the following command to initialize the workspace and apply the sample configuration.

```bash
terraform init && terraform apply
```

If you prefer to have your credentials in a separate file, create a `params.tfvars.json` file in the `examples` folder. Then add your parameters as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "client_id": "REMPLACE_HERE",
  "client_secret": "REMPLACE_HERE",
  "org_id": "REMPLACE_HERE"
}
```

Make sure to add the params file when you apply your terraform configuration as follow:

```bash
terraform init && terraform apply -var-file="params.tfvars.json"
```

### Debugging mode

First build the project using

```bash
go build
```

You should have a new file `terraform-provider-anypoint` in the root of the project. To start the provider in debug mode execute the following:

```bash
dlv exec --headless ./terraform-provider-anypoint -- --debug
```

Once executed, connect your debugger (whether it's your IDE or the debugger client) to the debugger server. The following is an example of how to start a client debugger:

```bash
dlv connect 127.0.0.1:51495
```

Then have your client debugger `continue` execution (check the help for more info) then your provider should print something like:

```bash
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"anypoint.mulesoft.com/automation/anypoint":{"Protocol":"grpc","Pid":69612,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/yc/k0_j_x0945jdthsw7fzw5ysh0000gp/T/plugin598168131"}}}'
```

Now you can run terraform using the debugger, here's an example:

```bash
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"anypoint.mulesoft.com/automation/anypoint":{"Protocol":"grpc","Pid":69612,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/yc/k0_j_x0945jdthsw7fzw5ysh0000gp/T/plugin598168131"}}}' terraform apply --auto-approve -var-file="params.tfvars.json"
```

> **N.B:** Make sure that your script uses the source `anypoint.mulesoft.com/automation/anypoint`. Otherwise, it won't work.

#### How to log

Use `log` package to log. Here's an exampe:

```go
log.Println("[DEBUG] Something happened!")
```
